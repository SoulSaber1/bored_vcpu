# custom_cpu

I made this project to try to instrument a custom CPU, as well as an
assembler, and a custom assembly language. If you find this useful, cool.

Progress will be ongoing, and might be slow.

The compiler.py file will read the code.csm file, and assemble it into the code file.


Every instruction is 32 bytes long. This doesn't really matter for now, but will
eventually facilitate more instructions. Probably.
